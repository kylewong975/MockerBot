# SlackBots
A collection of slack bots I made and will make, for both serious and trolling 
purposes

### List of Slack Bots I made
Mocker: My first Slack Bot. For every message a user sends, this bot mocks 
you, like the Spongebob mocking meme you probably have seen. In other words, 
it will capitalize random letters in your message at random, sending a message 
with a mocking manner.
