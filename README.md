# MockerBot

This is a Slack Bot App that is made using JavaScript and JSON, with 
the stdlib as a pseudo-server such that I do not need to host 
through an actual server to run this Slack Bot.

This Slack Bot mocks you, like the Spongebob mocking meme you probably 
have seen. In other words, it will capitalize random letters in your 
message at random, sending a message with a mocking manner. Note that 
most of the memes capitalize every other word, but I just wanted to 
make it a bit more fun and interesting by randomizing it (1 in 2 
chance to capitalize a letter). 

This SlackBot is not distributed yet, but here is an image of what the 
Slack Bot does. 
Very annoying indeed!

Note: The mocker.py is the Python version of the script, which requires 
a server to run, so running `python mocker.py` itself will not work.
